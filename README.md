# tabiya-open-dataset
Welcome to 'tabiya-open-dataset'.

It contains ESCO models in a CSV format that can be imported into the Tabiya Open Taxonomy Platform.

The files can also be used as a standalone dataset for other purposes, e.g. for data analysis or for importing into other systems.

The Tabiya Open Taxonomy builds and extends the ESCO classification.

The ESCO (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations) classification system is a European standard that provides a standardized and multilingual framework for describing occupations, skills, and qualifications. The ESCO classification is widely used in various industries and sectors to facilitate labor market analysis, skills matching, and career development.
